# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the 
# X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). 
# 
#  The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (
# i.e., √(x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²). 
# 
#  You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be 
# unique (except for the order that it is in). 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [
# [-2,2]].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= k <= points.length <= 10⁴ 
#  -10⁴ <= xi, yi <= 10⁴
