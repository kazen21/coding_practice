# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and 
# a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. 
# Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must 
# be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time. 
# 
#  Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2 
#  
# 
#  Output: 8 
# 
#  Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A ->
#  B. 
# 
#  After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The 
# same applies to task B. In the 3ʳᵈ interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you 
# idle. By the 4ᵗʰ cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1 
#  
# 
#  Output: 6 
# 
#  Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B. 
# 
#  With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other 
# task. 
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3 
#  
# 
#  Output: 10 
# 
#  Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> 
# idle -> idle -> A -> B. 
# 
#  There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 
# intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= tasks.length <= 10⁴ 
#  tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter. 
#  0 <= n <= 100
